To Do

1) DONE :: Wrap the processing of the image list in a check, if there are no images found do no try to process anything
but send an email to the recipient saying that there were no images.

2) Log4j configuration resolve the issue with the output stream so that we log to the file properly

3) Performance improvements
	1) Put each job found into its own thread so that it processes them in parallel.
